    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST HOMEMADE POMODORO</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds (565g) summer-ripe tomatoes (about 7 plum tomatoes; see notes), cut into 3/4-inch dice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 to 4 medium cloves garlic (about 1/2 to 1 ounce; 15-30g), finely minced by hand</li>
        <li>25 fresh basil leaves (25g), torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound (450g) dried spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, stir together tomatoes, olive oil, garlic (use fewer cloves if you want a more mild garlic flavor, and more if you welcome a stronger one), and basil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt, stir to combine, and let stand for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook spaghetti until al dente. Using tongs, transfer pasta to tomato mixture, reserving pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water, then transfer to bowl with tomatoes. Stir well to dress pasta with tomato mixture. If pasta becomes too dry, add reserved pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed to dress the pasta. Season with salt to taste. Transfer to individual serving bowls, and serve.</li>
